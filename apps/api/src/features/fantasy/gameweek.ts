/**
 * Gameweek logic for fantasy cricket.
 *
 * The fantasy season follows the cricket season calendar year.
 * Matches are played on Saturday-Sunday; each gameweek wraps one
 * match weekend together with the preceding edit period:
 *
 *   Mon 00:00 UK  →  Fri 23:59 UK   edit period  (team unlocked)
 *   Sat 00:00 UK  →  Sun 23:59 UK   match period (team locked)
 *
 * The gameweek number rolls over at Monday 00:00 UK — once the weekend's
 * matches are done, the "current gameweek" becomes the *next* weekend's.
 * GW1 is the exception: it has no edit period of its own (pre-season fills
 * that role), so GW1 only covers Sat-Sun of the first weekend.
 *
 * Pre-season (gameweek 0): before GW1's Saturday. Unlimited team changes.
 * In-season (gameweek 1+): max 3 transfers per gameweek, unless it's the
 * player's first-ever squad selection (which is always unlimited).
