## Compute — ECS Fargate

The API service runs on ARM/Graviton-based Fargate tasks. Production runs 2 tasks for availability during rolling deployments and to handle concurrent requests. Staging runs 1 task.

| Item | Spec | Unit Price | Monthly |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| vCPU (prod, 2 tasks) | 0.25 vCPU × 2 | $0.03725/vCPU-hr | $13.60 |
| Memory (prod, 2 tasks) | 0.5 GB × 2 | $0.00409/GB-hr | $2.99 |
| vCPU (staging, 1 task) | 0.25 vCPU | $0.03725/vCPU-hr | $6.80 |
| Memory (staging, 1 task) | 0.5 GB | $0.00409/GB-hr | $1.49 |
| **Subtotal** | | | **$24.88** |

Scheduled ECS tasks (data pipelines) run on-demand and cost fractions of a cent per execution at this scale.

## WAF

While the application already mitigates common attack vectors at the code level (parameterised queries via Kysely, auto-escaped output via React), WAF provides defence in depth at the infrastructure layer — rate limiting, geo-blocking, and managed rule sets that adapt to emerging threats without code changes. At ~$10/month this is a low-cost layer of protection that aligns with AWS security best practices.

## Cost Drivers

| Rank | Service | Monthly (2 envs) | % of Total | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | **NAT Gateway** | $70.80 | 37% | Conscious simplicity trade-off: required for private subnet outbound access. Alternatives (fck-nat, NAT instances) reduce cost but add operational burden. We accept the managed NAT cost to keep networking simple and reliable. One per VPC. |
| 2 | **ALB** | $39.64 | 21% | Required for ECS service routing and health checks. One per environment. |
| 3 | **RDS** | $31.60 | 16% | Always-on instances. |
| 4 | **ECS Fargate** | $24.88 | 13% | Application compute. |
| 5 | **CloudWatch** | $12.27 | 6% | Grows with monitoring maturity. |
| 6 | **WAF** | $10.30 | 5% | Recommended for application security. |
| 7 | **Everything else** | $2.83 | 1% | S3, CloudFront, SES, Route 53, ECR, SSM, EventBridge |

---

## Cost Optimisation Options

| Option | Potential Savings | Trade-off |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Single RDS instance** for prod + staging (separate databases) | ~$16/mo | Shared resource; staging load could affect production |
| **Fargate Spot** for staging tasks | ~$8/mo | Tasks can be interrupted (acceptable for non-production) |
| **Reserved Instances** for RDS (1-year no-upfront) | ~30% on RDS (~$10/mo) | Upfront commitment |
| **Compute Savings Plans** (1-year) | ~20% on Fargate (~$5/mo) | Upfront commitment |
| **Share NAT Gateway** across prod + staging via VPC peering | ~$35/mo | Cross-account networking complexity |

---

## Phased Cost Build-Up

Infrastructure is provisioned incrementally. Not all costs are incurred from day one:

| Phase | New AWS Services Added | Incremental Monthly Cost | Cumulative Monthly Cost |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation & Database** | RDS (prod), Route 53, SES, S3, VPC + NAT (prod) | ~$50 | ~$50 |
| **Phase 2: Backend Service** | ECS Fargate (prod, 2 tasks), ALB (prod), ECR, CloudWatch, WAF | ~$58 | ~$108 |
| **Phase 3: Data Pipelines** | ECS scheduled tasks (on-demand, minimal cost) | ~$1 | ~$109 |
| **Phase 4: Frontend Migration** | CloudFront (frontend) — mostly within free tier | ~$1 | ~$110 |
| **Phase 5: Content Migration** | No new services (uses existing RDS + S3) | $0 | ~$110 |
| **Phase 6: Staging & Cutover** | RDS (staging), ECS (staging, 1 task), ALB (staging), NAT (staging), CloudWatch (staging) | ~$83 | ~$193 |

The initial migration (Phases 1–2) runs on approximately **$108/month**. Full production + staging with all services reaches approximately **$193/month**.

---

## Annual Cost Projection

| Scenario | Monthly | Annual |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Production + Staging (full plan) | ~$192 | ~$2,304 |
| Production only (initial phase) | ~$108 | ~$1,296 |

Costs are conservative estimates based on current usage patterns. Actual costs may be lower in early phases before all services are provisioned, and may increase modestly as monitoring and pipeline maturity grows.

---

## Credits Request

Based on the infrastructure plan above, we are requesting AWS non-profit credits to cover:

### Year 1: Migration + Full Infrastructure

| Item | Annual Cost |
|------|-----------|
| **Steady-state infrastructure** (production + staging) | ~$2,300 |
| **Migration experimentation** (parallel running during cutover, testing instance sizes and configurations) | ~$700 |
| **Year 1 total** | **~$3,000** |

### Year 2+: Steady-State + Growth

| Item | Annual Cost |
|------|-----------|
| **Steady-state infrastructure** | ~$2,300 |
| **Growth headroom** | ~$500 |
| **Year 2+ total** | **~$2,800** |

Growth headroom accounts for specific scaling triggers: if membership doubles (~400 members), RDS scales to db.t4g.small and ECS adds a third task. Expanded monitoring (additional CloudWatch dashboards, metrics, alarms) also grows modestly with operational maturity.

A credit allocation of **$5,000/year** would cover our planned infrastructure across both the migration year and subsequent steady-state operations, with room for the growth scenarios above.
