# AWS Migration Proposal

## Community Impact

Percy Main CSC serves as grassroots sports infrastructure for North Tyneside — the web application is not just a club website but the operational backbone for youth participation, volunteer coordination, and community engagement. It manages junior and senior membership subscriptions, coordinates match-day logistics across multiple teams, runs a fantasy cricket league that keeps members engaged between fixtures, and provides trustees with the administrative tools to run the club without relying on spreadsheets or manual processes. Investing in reliable, professional infrastructure directly supports the club's ability to grow youth programmes, retain volunteers, and sustain the kind of local sporting community that depends on accessible, well-run digital services.

## Current Architecture

We currently run on a mix of third-party services:

## Architectural Improvements

This migration is also an opportunity to modernise our application architecture. The site has grown from a content-focused website into a full application with membership management, payment processing, a fantasy cricket game, and match administration.

### Frontend: Astro → React + Vite SPA

The site currently uses Astro (a static site generator) with React "islands" for interactive features. In practice, ~60% of features by complexity are full React applications wrapped in thin Astro shells. We propose migrating to a **React + Vite single-page application** deployed as static files to S3 and served via CloudFront.

Astro does support Node.js SSR adapters (deployable to ECS) and static output (deployable to S3+CloudFront), so continuing with Astro on AWS is technically feasible. However, the migration is an opportunity to resolve a growing architectural tension: the application has evolved from a content site into an interactive, authenticated platform where the Astro/React split creates friction — duplicated routing concepts, awkward state sharing between islands, and server/client boundary complexity that adds development overhead without proportionate benefit. A unified React SPA better reflects what the application actually is.

**Benefits:**
- Single framework — eliminates the Astro/React split and associated complexity
- Shared application state — auth context, data caching, and query providers work across the entire app
- Standard tooling — React Router for client-side routing, Vite for builds
- Simple deployment — static assets on S3, no server-side rendering infrastructure needed

**Trade-off — public content discoverability:** A SPA loses Astro's static-first rendering for public pages (fixtures, results, scorecards, news). Modern search engines handle SPAs well, and our members navigate directly to the site rather than discovering it via search. Social sharing link previews (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.) will show generic site metadata rather than page-specific content — an acceptable trade-off given the authenticated, interactive nature of most of the application. Page-specific previews can be revisited in future (e.g. pre-rendering or edge functions for social crawlers) but are out of scope for this migration.

### Backend: Serverless Functions → Node.js API Service on ECS

Our backend logic (~9,550 lines across 19 handler files) currently runs inside Astro's serverless action system with no service layer separation. We propose extracting this into a standalone **Node.js API service** running on ECS Fargate.

**Benefits:**
- Service layer reuse — scheduled jobs, webhooks, and the frontend all use the same business logic
- Independent scaling — API scales separately from frontend delivery
- Connection pooling — persistent service enables proper PostgreSQL connection pooling
- Framework-agnostic — frontend can evolve without affecting the backend
- Testable — plain request/response handlers with no framework coupling

### CMS: Contentful → Inline Content

Contentful currently manages ~6 content types via 4 API tokens, 6 npm packages, and a type generation pipeline. Content is edited by a single developer and already requires a deploy to publish (Astro fetches from Contentful at build time). We propose removing Contentful entirely and inlining editorial content directly as React components.

**Benefits:**
- Zero regression in publishing workflow — "edit → commit → deploy" is already the process
- Massively simplified stack — removes external API, 4 tokens, 6 npm packages, and the type generation pipeline
- Content is version-controlled, type-safe, and requires no runtime fetching
- No CMS infrastructure to build or maintain

### Data Pipelines: Monolithic Sync → Decoupled ETL

Our external data ingestion (Play Cricket match results, player statistics) currently runs as a single monolithic background function. We propose separating this into independent, resumable pipeline stages orchestrated by EventBridge.

**Benefits:**
- Decoupled ingestion and serving — external API issues do not affect user experience
- Independent pipeline stages — ingest, scoring, and cache refresh run and fail independently
- Idempotent and resumable — partial failures are recovered automatically on next run
- Observability — structured CloudWatch metrics per pipeline stage

## Account Structure

```
Percy Main AWS Organization
├── Production Account
│   ├── VPC + NAT Gateway
│   ├── ECS Fargate (API service, 2 tasks)
│   ├── ALB (API routing + health checks)
│   ├── RDS PostgreSQL (production data)
│   ├── S3 (frontend assets + user uploads)
│   ├── CloudFront (CDN)
│   ├── SES (transactional email)
│   ├── Route 53 (DNS)
│   ├── CloudWatch (monitoring + alerting)
│   └── WAF (application firewall)
│
├── Staging Account
│   ├── VPC + NAT Gateway
│   ├── ECS Fargate (API service, 1 task)
│   ├── ALB
│   ├── RDS PostgreSQL (staging data, seeded from production snapshot)
│   ├── S3 + CloudFront (frontend)
│   └── CloudWatch
│
└── Preview (shared with Staging)
    ├── Per-PR PostgreSQL schemas (within staging RDS instance)
    └── Per-PR S3 prefixes for frontend builds
```

Separate accounts provide blast radius isolation, independent IAM policies, and per-environment cost visibility. We currently have no staging environment — deploy previews are our only pre-production testing.

**Why separate accounts rather than a single account with resource-level separation?** A single account with tags and separate VPCs would be simpler to operate day-to-day. However, account-level isolation is the AWS-recommended best practice for environment separation — it provides hard IAM boundaries (a misconfigured staging policy cannot affect production resources), independent service quotas, and clean per-environment cost reporting without relying on tagging discipline. For a project funded by AWS non-profit credits, following AWS's own well-architected guidance is the right call. The additional IAM complexity (cross-account roles for CI/CD) is a one-time setup cost managed through Terraform.

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Sustainable funding** | AWS non-profit credits would replace personal trustee funding, securing infrastructure long-term |
| **Professional monitoring** | CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and dashboards — currently no monitoring capability |
| **Application security** | WAF, VPC, Security Groups, IAM, encryption at rest, CloudTrail audit logging |
| **Automated backups** | RDS automated daily snapshots with 35-day point-in-time recovery; staging environment is periodically seeded from a production snapshot restore, which doubles as a backup verification test |
| **PostgreSQL** | Full-text search, JSON operators, window functions, CTEs, mature ecosystem |
| **Environment parity** | Production, staging, and preview environments |
| **Scalability** | Scale ECS tasks, upgrade RDS instance, or add read replicas as membership grows |
| **Consolidated billing** | Single AWS account replaces four separate service subscriptions |
| **Data pipeline resilience** | Decoupled ingestion and serving |
| **Operational maturity** | Structured logging, alerting, and environment isolation |
